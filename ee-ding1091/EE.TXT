EE (Easy Editor)
----------------

There are many ASCII editors around, but I still find that I use my
editor most often. Taking EMACS (one of the best) as an example, it
is too slow to load when I am running TeX; too many different
versions even within an operating system; too many commands to
remember, but still don't have the ones you want.

EE is public domain with source code. It has all of basic editing
functions like search/replace, block delete/paste, word
wrap/paragraph fill etc. It is small enough to maintain when you
have a new OS, or just changed your taste of style. Compromises
have to be made to make EE small and useful including the
followings:

* If tab characters are find, it will expand/compress the file.
Otherwise it keep the spaces (good for fixed format data file).

* It uses two windows, but only keeps one file structure in buffer.
It works just like windows.

* Whenever possible, portable code between IBM and mainframe
machine are used.

Of course, you can always change it if it doesn't fit your
situation. If you like some of the code, you can make the author
very happy by sending one dollar ($1) to his sweetheart:
